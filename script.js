// Should the questions be inside alerts?
// There should be a start button, which then starts the timer (timer set for certain length of time, maybe 60 seconds?)

// Once user clicks start, start button should disappear and first question should appear. 

// When first question if answered:
    // If it's correct, goes to next question. If it's wrong, time is subtracted from the timer. 

    // When timer get to zero, or when all questions have been answered, which ever comes first
        // timer stops counting down and either displays 00:00 or disappears
        // card will appear showing the user's score and time used
